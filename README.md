This platform utilizes an advanced image classification model trained on the FER-2013 dataset to analyze facial expressions in uploaded photos. The model identifies emotions across seven key categories: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutrality. Simply upload a clear frontal face photo using the form, and the system will process the image to predict the dominant emotion displayed. This core technology achieves a benchmark accuracy of 67% on the standard FER-2013 test set, demonstrating its capability to recognize complex emotional cues.
