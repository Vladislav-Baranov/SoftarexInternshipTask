<p>The FER-2013 dataset is a widely recognized benchmark in affective computing, consisting of over 35,000 facial expressions representing real-world diversity. While our model provides insightful analysis, it's important to note that emotion recognition from static images remains a challenging field; factors like lighting, head angle, and individual expressiveness can influence results. This tool serves as a demonstration of AI's potential in understanding human emotions and can be used for educational exploration, user experience research, or as a foundation for further development. We continuously strive to improve accuracy and welcome feedback on the system's performance.</p>
